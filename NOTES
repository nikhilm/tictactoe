                   |-> Webdis
Client -> HAProxy -
                   |-> nginx

nginx used for static files
- why not another server, because nginx powers my other domains already

why not Client -> nginx -> Webdis ?
nginx can't use HTTP/1.1 upstream. Keep-Alive + Webdis PUB/SUB was malfunctioning in number of connected subscribers due to that.
